Feature: User can see products in different categories
  As a visitor
  In order to get an overview of the restaurant's products
  I would like to be able to see a menu

  Background:
    Given the following products exist:
      | category | name          | description   | price |
      | starter  | Starter 1     | First course  | 99    |
      | main     | Main Course 1 | Second course | 150   |
      | dessert  | Dessert 1     | Last course   | 39    |
    And I am on the landing page

  Scenario: Can see products in different categories
    Then I should see "Greta's Top Picks"
    And I should see "starter"
    And I should see "Starter 1"
    And I should see "First course"
    And I should see "99"
    And I should see "Main Course 1"
    And I should see "Dessert 1"
